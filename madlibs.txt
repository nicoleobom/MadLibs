No Christmas season can really be adjective unless you have a/an adjective2 tree in your room.

If you live in a city, you will see many vacant plural filled with hundreds of plural2 for sale.

If you live in the country, you can get your own noun right out of the forest. Go out with a/an noun2 and noun3, and when you see a/an adjective3 tree you like, you can dig it up and plant it in a/an noun4.

Then, you can use it for number years. 

To make sure your tree is fresh, shake the branches and see if the plural3 fall off onto the noun5. And make sure the tree is very color. 

(Nothing looks worse then a/an color2 tree.)

Just follow these directions and you can have a perfectly beautiful something-alive in your front room for weeks. Remember, poems and MadLibs are made by fools like person-in-room, but only person-in-room2 can make a tree.
